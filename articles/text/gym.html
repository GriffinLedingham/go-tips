    What Are They?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Gyms are special points of interest found throughout the world. You can capture a Gym for your Team and battle the Pokémon of rival Teams there. Gyms can be challenged by multiple Trainers at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Gym’s level is determined by its <em>prestige</em>. As a Gym earns prestige, it increases in level. The higher a Gym’s level, the more Pokémon can be assigned to it, which makes it harder for rival Teams to capture. A Gym’s prestige increases when you assign a trained Pokémon to it, and also when teammates assign additional Pokémon.
